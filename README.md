# Simultaneous Translator of Brazilian Sign Language for Deaf and Hearing Individuals in Brazilian High School Education

###### AUTOR: ALYSSON C. C. CORDEIRO - COMPUTER ENGINEER

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a simultaneous translation system for Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) to Portuguese text and/or speech, using computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques. The system is capable of recognizing static gestures (such as numbers and letters) and, in the future, facial expressions, promoting social inclusion for deaf individuals in educational contexts. The solution will be based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for gesture recognition and may be integrated with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to capture temporal sequences in dynamic gestures.

| **Aspect**               | **Details**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Functionalities**      | Recognition of numbers, letters, and facial expressions in Libras; real-time translation to text/speech |
| **Accuracy**             | High accuracy for static gestures; under development for dynamic gestures   |
| **Response Time**        | Operates in real-time                                                       |
| **Accessibility**        | Low-cost solution, accessible for Brazilian high schools                    |
| **Coverage**             | Initial focus on basic signs; potential for expansion to other signs and regional Libras variations |
| **Key Features**         | Future integration of facial expressions; validation with the deaf community; scalability |
