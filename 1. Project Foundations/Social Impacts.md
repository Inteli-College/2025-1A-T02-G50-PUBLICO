# Social Impacts of the Project's Actions

Communication is a fundamental right and a basic necessity for social participation. In Brazil, Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) is recognized as the country’s second official language and the primary means of communication for the deaf community (BRASIL, 2002). However, the limited dissemination of Libras among hearing individuals and the shortage of qualified interpreters create significant barriers in Brazilian education and access to essential services.

For this reason, the development of a real-time translation system from Libras to Portuguese (text and speech), using computer vision and artificial intelligence (through CNNs and RNNs), has the potential to generate significant social impacts—both positive and negative—in Brazilian secondary education. These impacts must be carefully analyzed to ensure the project meets the needs of the deaf community in these schools and promotes ethical and effective inclusion.

### Positive Impacts:

One of the main positive impacts is the potential to improve access to education for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Currently, the shortage of Libras interpreters in Brazilian schools represents one of the main learning barriers for these students, as noted by experts and official agencies (AGÊNCIA CÂMARA DE NOTÍCIAS, 2019). This linguistic barrier compromises the mediation of school content, as many deaf students cannot fully understand what is conveyed orally in the classroom (MADALENA, 2018). With an automated translation system adapted for secondary education, deaf students could follow classes in real time without relying exclusively on human interpreters. This could reduce dropout rates and improve academic performance, increasing their chances of accessing higher education in the future.

Additionally, in professional settings, communication barriers between deaf and hearing individuals often hinder the hiring and retention of deaf professionals, especially teachers with hearing impairments who face challenges in daily school activities. A real-time translation system could facilitate communication in meetings, training sessions, and daily interactions with students who may also have hearing impairments, promoting workplace inclusion. It is worth noting that school dropout among deaf students is often a result of a lack of communicative accessibility and adequate pedagogical support, as indicated by studies conducted in the context of Brazilian public education (CARVALHO et al., 2017).

Another relevant positive aspect would be the valorization of Libras and deaf culture in Brazil. By developing a technology that recognizes and translates Libras, the project highlights its importance as a complete and autonomous language. This could lead to greater appreciation of deaf culture and a reduction in prejudice and discrimination against deaf individuals, promoting their integration into Brazilian society (SKLIAR, 1998).

### Negative Impacts:

Despite these benefits, the project may also have negative impacts. Excessive reliance on technology could reduce the demand for human interpreters and specialized Libras teachers, negatively affecting professionals in the field—especially if the system cannot handle all the nuances and complexities of Libras, including regional variations and facial expressions.

Additionally, the system’s accuracy poses a major challenge. Libras is a complex language with regional variations and essential facial expressions. If the system fails to recognize and translate these nuances accurately, it could lead to misunderstandings and frustration among users. Latency (translation delay) could also be a problem in situations requiring quick and efficient communication.

Finally, while the project may represent a more financially accessible solution than hiring human interpreters, there is a risk that the system could still be too expensive for some institutions and community schools. This could limit access to the technology, particularly in under-resourced regions.
