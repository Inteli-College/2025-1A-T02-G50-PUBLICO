# Social Impacts of the Project's Actions

Communication is a fundamental right and a basic need for social participation. In Brazil, Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) is recognized as the country's second official language and the primary means of communication for the deaf community. However, the limited dissemination of Libras among hearing individuals and the shortage of qualified interpreters create significant barriers in Brazilian education and access to essential services.

For this reason, developing a real-time translation system for Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) to Portuguese (text and speech) using computer vision and artificial intelligence (CNNs and RNNs) has the potential to generate significant social impacts - both positive and negative - in Brazilian high school education. These impacts must be carefully analyzed to ensure the project meets the needs of the deaf community within these schools and promotes ethical, effective inclusion.

### Positive Impacts:

One of the main positive impacts is the potential to improve educational access for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Currently, the lack of Libras interpreters in Brazilian schools is a significant learning barrier. With an automatic translation system specifically adapted for high school students, deaf students could follow classes in real time without relying exclusively on human interpreters. This could reduce dropout rates and improve academic performance of deaf students, potentially increasing future university enrollment.

Furthermore, in professional environments, communication barriers between deaf and hearing individuals frequently hinder the hiring and retention of deaf professionals, particularly teachers with hearing disabilities who face challenges in daily school activities. A real-time translation system could facilitate communication in meetings, trainings, and daily interactions with students who may also have hearing impairments, thereby increasing employment opportunities and workplace inclusion for deaf professionals.

Another important positive aspect would be the valorization of Libras and deaf culture in Brazil. By developing technology that recognizes and translates Libras, the project highlights its importance as a complete and autonomous language. This could lead to greater appreciation of deaf culture and reduced prejudice and discrimination against deaf individuals, fostering better integration of the deaf community into Brazilian society.

### Negative Impacts:

Despite these benefits, the project also carries potential negative impacts. Excessive reliance on technology could reduce demand for human interpreters and specialized sign language teachers, potentially harming professionals in this field - especially if the system cannot handle all the nuances and complexities of Libras, including regional variations and facial expressions.

Moreover, system accuracy presents a significant challenge. Libras is a complex language with regional variations and essential facial expressions. If the system fails to accurately recognize and translate these nuances, it could create misunderstandings and user frustration. Latency (translation delay) may also pose problems in situations requiring quick, efficient communication.

Finally, while the project could be more financially accessible than hiring human interpreters, there's a risk the system might still be too expensive for some institutions and community schools. This could limit technology access, particularly in underfunded regions.
