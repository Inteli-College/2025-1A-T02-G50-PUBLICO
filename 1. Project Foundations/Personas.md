# Personas:

## Persona 1

### General Information:

Name: Ana Clara de Sousa Silva

Age: 16 years old

Location: São Paulo, SP, Brazil

Education: Public high school student (10th grade)

Profile: Ana Clara is a congenitally deaf and non-verbal young woman (non-hereditary condition) who uses Brazilian Sign Language (Libras) as her primary means of daily communication. She is dedicated to her studies and preparing for college entrance exams, dreaming of attending university. However, she faces daily challenges in communicating with hearing classmates and teachers.

### ANA'S QUOTES:

*"I want to learn just like everyone else, but I often feel lost because I can’t follow the classes without an interpreter."*  

*"It’s hard to make friends when nobody knows Libras (Brazilian Sign Language). I wish I could talk more with my classmates."*  

*"I dream of going to college, but I’m afraid I won’t be ready for the entrance exams. Most of the time, I can’t ask my teachers for help with subjects like math as precisely as I need to."*  



### NEEDS AND CHALLENGES:

I. Classroom Communication:

- Ana relies on Libras (Brazilian Sign Language) interpreters to follow lessons, but her school only has one interpreter for multiple classes, limiting her access to content.

- Most teachers don’t know Libras, making direct interaction with Ana about the material difficult—especially during mock tests and exams.


II. Access to Learning Materials:

- Most educational materials aren’t adapted for deaf students, forcing Ana to depend on manual translations or interpreters.

- She feels she misses part of the content because she can’t keep up in real-time.


III. Social Inclusion:

- Ana often feels isolated from hearing classmates due to limited communication.

- She wants to participate more actively in group activities and classroom discussions.


IV. College Entrance Exam Preparation:

- Ana is worried about the exams because she feels she isn’t receiving the same level of preparation as her hearing peers.

- She needs tools to help her study independently and efficiently. Given her intermediate tech skills, she sometimes has to pay for private tutors for extra support.


### FRUSTRATIONS AND BARRIERS:

- Ana is frustrated by the lack of accessibility at her school, such as the shortage of interpreters and adapted materials.

- She feels the school isn’t equipped to meet the needs of deaf students.

- Limited communication with peers and teachers leads to frustration and isolation.

- Ana often feels excluded from group activities and classroom discussions that could help with future college entrance exams.

- Her dependence on interpreters restricts her autonomy and independence.

- She wishes she had more control over her own communication and learning process.


### GOALS:

- Follow classes in real time without relying solely on interpreters.  

- Improve academic performance and prepare for college entrance exams.  

- Enhance communication with classmates and teachers, promoting social inclusion.  

- Actively participate in group activities and classroom discussions.  

- Gain greater autonomy and confidence in her ability to communicate and learn.  

- Reduce dependence on interpreters and facilitate interaction with the hearing world.  


### ABOUT THE PROJECT:

- An automatic **Libras-to-text/speech translation system** would allow Ana to follow lessons in real time, even without an interpreter present.  

- Teachers and classmates could communicate with Ana more efficiently by using the system to translate their speech into Libras.  

- Ana could study independently, using the system to access educational content.  

- The system would improve communication between Ana and her peers, fostering social inclusion and participation in group activities.  

- With the system, Ana could access video lessons, practice exams, and other college prep materials automatically translated into Libras.

- Video tutorials or educational games in Libras could teach Lucas and classmates better interaction skills.  

- Accessible group chats (with auto-captions/translation) would facilitate Ana's participation in conversations.
